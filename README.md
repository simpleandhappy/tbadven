## Text Based Adventure Game

Was super bored one day and was in the middle of watching a doc series on Youtube made by a channel ThatGuyGlen.

It was inspiring listening to the stories of studios working on games with no experience and they all seemed to have fun. Missing the days of enjoying working on computers thought I could do the same. But later realized I have no experience whatsoever making video games. So the initial thinking was why not make a text based game. Donâ€™t need to worry about some visual assets or graphics, it's all text so whatever.

I used to love playing that game Zork. So let me make a game like that. And then started the journey to make a zork clone.
